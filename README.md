My first attempt at creating a personal website. 

Really basic build, I used bootstrap and long summer days.

I played around with some basic design principals, that I got from some model websites and this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIULMnbH2-o&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBPw1sFodruZUPheWVKchlM

I'm transitioning to building an article reader app so that I can chart my opnions on current news stories (and stay up to date).
